Notes for Netgear R7800

# Thirfting
I found a Netgear R7800 at a local thrift store, it was priced at $9.99 but it was 20% off day so I was out the door for less than $9 after tax.

# Powering up
I plugged in the router and to my surprise, the router had not been reset to a factory default before being donated. I observed the following SSID broadcasted:

...do with that what you will...

# Password Recovery
Now that I realized the router was still configured, I wondered if I could recover the password for the wireless network, as well as any other configured passwords. I followed along with Matt Brown's video here which was fantastic. I recommend subscribing to Matt's channel he has some really good content.

# Locating UART
I opened up the case and found four pins that look like UART, but they were not labeled. However I was able to follow the steps in Matt's video and use a multimeter to locate the Ground, Send and Recieve pins.
